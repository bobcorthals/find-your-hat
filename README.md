## Description

Game written in JavaScript that can be run in the terminal with Node.js. The player has lost his hat and should navigate a field set with occasional "holes" in order to retrieve it.

### Aims

The aim of this [Codecademy project](https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/find-your-hat-challenge-project-javascript/462380) was to build a terminal game that works with user input in Node.js. The project's primary requirement was to set up a `Field` class that: 

1. generates a 2D array (the "field") with traversable areas (`░`), several "holes" (`O`), one "hat" (`^`), and the player (`*`);
2. keeps track of the player's movements (`user input`) until the player has either won (found the hat) or lost (fell down a hole | stepped outside the field).

Extensions of the project past requirements:

3. Functionality that allows the player to set the dimensions of the field;
4. Countdown in the terminal before generating the field;
5. Addition of arrows to represent the player's previous movements (e.g. `↑`, `↓`);
6. A `Score` class that keeps track of the player's results and prints them at termination.

### Technologies

* JavaScript
* Node.js
* Git and Github
* Markdown

### Detailed description

After running `node main.js` in the terminal, the user is prompted to start a new game (`(Y)es, (N)o`).* On `Y`, the user is asked to provide the dimensions of the field to be generated. A sample field is printed to the terminal to help the user understand which values are to be supplied (`x = width`, `y = length`).

<sub>\* Evaluation of user input is case-insensitive throughout. In case of `invalid input`, custom messages appear to encourage the user to remedy the situation.</sub>

As soon as the user has provided correct input, a mock countdown is printed to the terminal, while we "wait" for the construction of the field.

Next, the field is printed, and the user is asked to provide directions, using the keys `U, D, L, R` (up, down, left, right). Throughout the player can quit the game with `Q`. After each input the field will be "updated" in place.

The prompts for directions continue until the player:
* inputs `Q`;
* steps out of bounds ("loss");
* falls down a "hole" ("loss");
* finds the lost hat ("win"); 

In case of a "loss", a short message is displayed underneath the field to explain to the user *why* s/he lost: e.g. "Oh no! You moved outside the field at (x, y)!" or "You fell into a hole at (x, y)!".

In case of a "win", a similar message will appear to show how many moves it took the player to find the hat (e.g. "You found your hat in *n* moves!").

In either scenario, the player is invited to play another game. If so, the process is simply repeated. If the player decides to leave the game, there will appear on termination a print-out of the player's results. 

Example print-out:

- Games played: 3;  
  - Moved out of bounds: 0
  - Fell in a hole: 1
  - Found your hat: 1
    - Win 1 (field: (6, 6)): 4 moves in 2.6 seconds.

### Future optimalization

At the moment, the field generated by `Field.generateField()` *may* produce insoluble fields (e.g. all access points to the hat may be cut off by "holes"). In such an event, the user has no choice but to lose (step out of bounds, fall into a hole) or quit (`Q`). A field validator could be implemented based on the [maze-solving algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze-solving_algorithm) to ensure the possibility of reaching the hat.

Another (easier) improvement may consist of randomizing the player's starting position. As is, the player always starts at `(0, 0)` (top-left corner).
